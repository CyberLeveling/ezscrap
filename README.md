Core Functionalities:

File Duplication and Modification: At its core, the script starts by duplicating content from an input file to an output file, line by line, effectively doubling the content. It then reads this output, identifies unique lines, and modifies them by prefixing URLs with "http://" or "https://", depending on their existing content, storing the results in a new file.

Performance Measurement: The script is built with a keen eye on performance, incorporating timers to measure and report the duration of specific operations, providing insights into the script's efficiency at runtime.

Network Interaction: Diving into network operations, the script uses a custom HTTP client to bypass SSL verification, fetches URLs from a file, and makes HTTP GET requests to these URLs. It's a fundamental demonstration of Go's networking capabilities, handling each URL with the intent to extract and compile data from the web.

Data Extraction: The script showcases its data extraction prowess by parsing the content fetched from URLs to find additional URLs and email addresses, demonstrating a simple yet effective scraping mechanism. This data is then written to respective files for further analysis or use.

Content Sorting and Filtering: Further, the script sorts through the extracted URLs and emails, removing duplicates and categorizing them based on specific criteria (like file extensions), which is a handy feature for data organization and analysis.

Recursive Enhancement: An intriguing aspect of the script is its recursive nature, where it iteratively applies its logic to refine the data further, enhancing the quality and relevance of the output with each pass.

Conclusion:

This Go script is a testament to the language's capability to handle a variety of tasks, from file manipulation to network requests and data processing. It serves as a robust example for developers looking to understand how to combine these elements effectively in their Go applications. Whether you're a novice intrigued by Go's potential or an experienced developer seeking to enhance your toolset, this script offers a comprehensive glimpse into the practical application of Go's versatile features.
